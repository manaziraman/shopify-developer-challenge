# shopify-developer-challenge

This is my Shopify Developer Challenge submission for the backend developer internship role. 

EXPLANATION:

I used Java to create a basic file/image repository. If you run the main class, you'll be presented with several different options. You can:
1) add image
2) delete image
3) download image (and remove it)
4) clear repository
5) quit application

When you select each of the options, you do so by typing the # of choice and then hitting enter. You'll then be provided with a series of steps, usually
identifying the file to add/remove or the location to download it to. 

If you're curious as to where the files are stored, you can open the repository folder in the project and they should all be moved into there from their
previous locations.
